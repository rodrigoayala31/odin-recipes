    <h3>Description</h2>
    <p>Caramel flan is a smooth and creamy custard dessert topped with a rich layer of golden caramel. Silky in texture and subtly sweet, this classic treat melts in your mouth with each spoonful. <br> Made with simple ingredients like eggs, milk, and sugar, flan is baked gently in a water bath to achieve its delicate consistency and glossy finish. <br> Perfectly chilled and inverted to reveal its glistening caramel top, it's a timeless dessert loved across many cultures.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) water</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz / 397g) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can (12 oz / 354ml) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the caramel:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar and water.</li>
            <li>Cook without stirring until the sugar melts and turns a deep golden brown.</li>
            <li>Immediately pour the caramel into a round cake pan or individual ramekins, swirling to coat the bottom evenly. Set aside to cool and harden.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Prepare the custard:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs.</li>
            <li>Add the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt (optional). Mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the custard mixture over the hardened caramel in the pan.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Bake the flan:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the pan in a larger baking dish and fill the outer dish with hot water (a water bath) until it reaches halfway up the sides of the flan pan.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350°F (175°C) for about 50–60 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Cool and Chill</li>
        <li>Unmold and Serve</li>
    </ol>
